        <p>Welcome. This full stack app was developed as an assignment for L7 Informatics.</p>
        <p>
          If you are viewing this app for the first time, there would probably be no data to begin with.
          For your convenience, I created a debug page with a script to fill preset data.
          Access it via the menu on the left side.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you encounter any issues, please contact me for fixes.
